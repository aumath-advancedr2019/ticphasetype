\title{Site Frequency Spectrum}
\usage{
sfs(n, theta = 2, init_probs = NULL, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size}

\item{theta}{population mutation parameter}

\item{init_probs}{vector of initial probabilities. There is no need to supply entire vector if most of its elements are zero. The function computes the rest automatically}

\item{plot}{logical}
}
\description{
This function returns a list of expected counts of itons up to n-1, or a plot if specified.
It builds the site frequency spectrum using Kingman's coalescent. It works for different
values of `theta` (population mutation parameter).
}
\details{
The initial probabilities can be specified by the user. If not specified, they will
automatically be constructed as the first state having a probability of 1 and the rest
a probability of 0.

By default, a list of expected values for each i-ton and its variance is returned.
If \code{plot=TRUE}, then a plot is returned.
}
\examples{
sfs(n = 5)
sfs(5, theta = 3)
sfs(10, 2, init_probs = c(0.8, 0.2))
